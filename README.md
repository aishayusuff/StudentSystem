# Student-System
A simple full stack project that accepts a student name and address from a user, and displays them (along with other students' information stored in the database) in a table. 

This project was built using React and Springboot.

For styling, I used react bootstrap and custom CSS styling. The backend was deployed using AWS elastic beanstalk and MySQL DB on through freehosting, and the frontend was deployed using netlify.
